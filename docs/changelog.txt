Version 0.2.1
    - We now reconstruct the final equation correctly
    - We now detect invalid characters within the charge component
    - Invalid token now contains the entire error slice, not just a character
    - Non ascii characters are now detected
        - Because we know all our input strings, and therefore slices, are ascii only, we use from_utf8_unchecked whe converting to &str
    - We now ensure that the input string has at least one equals sign, one reactant and one product
    - Without --verbose and --duration, ONLY the solved equation is displayed
    - Extra newline is prepended to duration
