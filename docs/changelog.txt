Version 0.2.3
    - We now remove whitespace before parsing, to make processing easier
    - Whitespace enum in TokenType has now been removed
    - solve_equation now takes a byte slice instead of a str slice
    - Groups with an implicit quantity (i.e. a quantity of one), for example (OH), (Fe), etc. are parsed correctly
    - --duration option added back in, used to show more accurate duration (i.e. without lengthy print calls)

Version 0.2.2
    - We now detect infinite solutions, and warn user accordingly
    - We now detect negative coefficients and warn user
    - Group component in token iterator now uses get_num_index function to get quantity
    - Since conversion from string to num can fail, float_string_to_ratio now returns a Result, which is propagated
    - We can now parse rational numbers too!!!
    - Showing the duration is now included in --verbose, --duration is removed
    - Added Error token to give more information than Invalid alone
    - Equation validation (via TokenIterator) is now performed in the first parse, not the second
    - parse_group now uses String instead of &str in its Result
    - format! changed to String::from where possible
    - We now detect invalid charges where the number is not at the beginning or at the end  i.e. {+22-}

Version 0.2.1
    - We now reconstruct the final equation correctly
    - We now detect invalid characters within the charge component
    - Invalid token now contains the entire error slice, not just a character
    - Non ascii characters are now detected
        - Because we know all our input strings, and therefore slices, are ascii only, we use from_utf8_unchecked whe converting to &str
    - We now ensure that the input string has at least one equals sign, one reactant and one product
    - Without --verbose and --duration, ONLY the solved equation is displayed
    - Extra newline is prepended to duration

Version 0.2.0
    - Complete overhaul of the string handling
    - Regex replaced with custom parser
    - We use string slices instead of String class
    - Better error handling for invalid equations
    - Charges and hydrate features now added
    - Whitespace is not ignored
	- Added debug and release cargo commands
	- Added option to show user calculation time (-d)
	- Fully changed project name to chembal
	- Formulae ending with a closing bracket and number bug fixed
	- Cleaner output in verbose mode
