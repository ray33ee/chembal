- Warn user that negative coefficients may result when molecules are on the 'wrong' side of the equation
- Create a better algorithm that substitutes coefficients into final equation.
    - The current algorithm works by matching occurences of '+' to identify the next molecule. However
      this will not work when positive charges are used (i.e. {+})
    - Implement a solution that uses the TokenIterator and identify new molecules with the TokenType::Separator
    - White space should be ignored in the final equation
    - Iterate over the function, and reconstruct the equation.
        - Should Groups, Symbols, etc. contain slices of the full string too??? Yes
